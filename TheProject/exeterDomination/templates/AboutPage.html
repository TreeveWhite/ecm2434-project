    <h1>What is Exeter Domination?</h1>
    <p>
        Exeter Domination is a fun and interactive game designed to take students, new or old, around the beautiful Exeter
        University Campus with the idea of showing people areas they may not have seen before and giving interesting facts about them,
        all whilst they play a fun and engaging game.
